                            In our daily life, communication helps us build relationships by allowing us to share our experiences, and needs, and helps us connect to others. It's the essence of life, allowing us to express feelings, pass on information and share thoughts. We all need to communicate.

                            Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises.

                            The reason you can say both 'dancing skills' and 'dance skills' is because 'dance' is a noun which is the same as the art form - like 'music skills'. Yes, you can say 'dancing club'. They are both fine.
